    "body": "Untold was the wind, in all its fury and might lay a quiet strength. Chained to no one, its power could not be overcome with the meagre flights of fancy which were characteristic of man. Neither thoughtless mistakes, nor vice could bring about the downfall of a god. But what of gods risen from man itself; do they possess the same affliction to undoing?\n\nA biting chill ran through their spine simultaneously. It was their time. \n\nOne stepped forward, a single pace closer towards the estuary of Styx. The other held fast, but winds of change always blew one towards their fate, regardless of a mere individual’s wish. Cocytus raged and cracked against the shore of dusty debris. Only three remained in the confines of perpetuity. The boundary between life and the underworld.\n\n“There is no rush.” Truly, time here did not pass as easily as it flowed above. It was barred against its will at this juncture. Nothing could pass without the permission of this place’s overseer. Whether it be mortal or the fabric of nature itself.\n\nThe others accepted, resigned, fought. Did it matter? Acheron, Lethe, and Phlegethon converged where it was always meant to converge.  \n\nIn this place and time, all were offered the same choice.\n\nHere, at this crossroad, or cross-river, was where something ended and something else began. \n\n\n“This is truly the bane of my existence,” They complained loudly.\n\n“Don’t you feel shame at using such mortal colloquialisms?” The blue flame bounced in agitation. “In the first place, your very existence is to uphold this tradition of leading souls into the afterlife. There is nothing banal or of bane in your duty.” All fires burned out eventually (though there existed quite a fair number of exceptions). It was Their charge to ferry souls as they extinguished.\n\n“Try doing this job your entire life with no end in sight, you’d think it dreadful in no time at all,” They retorted back.\n\nThe flame flickered in irritation, “Again with your very human expressions. Time does not pass here and you do not have a life.”\n\n“Tell me about it!”\n\n“Enough!” He burst, “I cannot stand your ceaseless whining a second longer!”\n\n“Now who’s speaking in mortal terms?”\n\n“You may think yourself of wit, but although you are millennia in the making, you act as juvenile as a mortal child!” Azure flames flared, the tendrils scattered in all directions. Indeed, the spirit guide had had enough with Them and went to go cool off. \n\nWhen the last vestiges quivered gone, They picked up their scythe. “Finally, some peace and quiet,” The harbinger of bereavement twirled in Their hands as easily as rain danced upon pools of water. “What a nag.” \n\nQuickly, They made preparations, driven by the covet of being left alone by the aforementioned nag. Mares of shadow neighed against the backdrop of a crackling storm which was steadily brewing. Darkness swept over the skies as Death rode their chariot towards the mortal realm. \n\nWherever They went, plague, war, and chaos did not fall far behind. In more apt terms, everytime They decided to play hooky, great destruction rained upon the human world. \n\nA great and terrible lesson was learned during 1250 BC. To the chagrin of the gods, Death managed to evade Their duties for ten years. So now, They had to be babysat, lest the Fields of Asphodel become overwhelmingly crowded yet again.\n\nBack to the present, it was thus that such an oversight brought five particularly unfortunate souls here. They converged at this boundary due to mere whimsy. \n"

    "body": "Everything under the sun is hiding away.\n\n“Even though it's not that cold,” I mutter, puffs of clouds rising from my breath.\n\nI would liken today's weather to a small animal’s nipping bites. She's already full, but doesn't know any other way to live except to continue eating. \n\nThis grey chill seems to seep into your bones the longer you stay out. But when my eyes are closed, I can feel the sunlight. Its caress is warm and gentle. Light seeps through my eyelids even when they're closed, causing striking golden patterns and shapes to form.\n\nSo, just like this stubborn creature, winter simply doesn't know when to give up. The flowers are all withered, but I still poke around the colorless leaves and stems.\n\nThinking about the Winter Court, I wonder if it's possible to bargain with them and ask to make next year a little warmer... Then mommy will come out to play with me.\n\nRustle rustle.\n\nThe mounds of dead growth a few meters away move a bit.\n\nWhoa, no way! Did I seriously summon the Winter Court? I-I was just joking, they're really scary. Please go back. Pleading silently with my eyes shut, I hear the rustling get closer and closer.\n\nN-Nooooo!\n\nA heartbeat of silence, then two.\n\nIt stopped...?\n\nI gradually open my eyes. A tuft of brown hair and wide, moss irises peer up at me from the dead flowers and frost.\n\n\"H-Hello,\" I stutter out.\n\nLittle stumps peek through a mess of fluffy hair.\n\nAntlers?\n\nSmall flecks of white freckles sprinkle throughout his face, mostly concentrating on his cold-pink nose. His eyes are so round and droopy, that I can't help but lower my guard.\n\n\"Hi..!\" He squeaks with a flittingly nervous voice. \"I'm Crescia. What's... What's your name? Where are your antlers? Oh. Are you a Human? Wow, you're so shiny and warm. I don't think I've ever seen a Human like you before.\" He suddenly bounds up from the decay. He's around the same size as I am.\n\nI feel myself break into another cold sweat. This barrage of questions... What do I answer first?\n\n\"My name is Aeriea Newlyn.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's a pretty name,\" He fidgets about.\n\n\"What about you? What are you?\"\n\n\"I don't really know what you mean? I'm Crescia.\"\n\nGiggling, I clarify, \"What's your species? Are you part of the Fairfolk?\"\n\nCrescia tilts his head questioningly, \"I'm part of a n-noda-mic tribe. We wander around and bring spring to beautiful hills and gardens!\"\n\n\"Ohhh! That sounds lovely! But I think the word is pronounced nomadic, Crescia.\"\n\nFlushing, he nods in embarrassment.\n\n\"Is there a name for your tribe?\"\n\n\"I guess we're called family.\" He sits back down and hides his face in the pile of grey leaves.\n\n\"Hehe, that's not a name but what you do with your family sounds nice.\"\n\nHe suddenly bounds up again, his face lit with excitement. \"Right! We make flowers bloom everywhere! It's really great!\"\n\nSo blindingly pure!\n\nQuickly recovering, I smile, \"How old are you? I'm seven years of age or seven constellation-cycles if that makes more sense.\"\n\nHe suddenly sits back down, only his antlers peeking through this time.\n\nH-huh? Oh no, is he embarrassed that he doesn't know so many things I'm asking him?\n\n\"Mrmm, I'm a young one.\"\n\nA... Young one?\n\n\"I'll be a strong one soon though, and then I'll be a wise one in the blink of an eye. Well, that's what the other wise ones tell us anyways.\"\n\nIs that how Crescia's tribe measures age? I couldn't help but smile at the difference. But even still, it's... Interesting. I wonder how else we're different, yet similar?\n\n\"I can't wait to be a strong one, they can do so many things! Like a trail of flowers follow and bloom behind them wherever they walk! Their voices are the strongest too!\"\n\nHis excitement is contagious and I can't help but be swept up by his smile. \"By the way, what did you mean earlier when you said I'm warm and shiny?\"\n\n\"Hmm, maybe that wasn't the right way to describe it,\" He tilts his head. Somehow this motion causes the dry leaves to flick up and down, crunching sounds crackle around us and snow flurries in the air because of this. \"You have this feeling like a-\" He pauses, \"Like a frozen lake.\"\n\nThat sounds like an insult...\n\n\"But when warm wind blows and the sun begins to shine, the ice thaws. The lake is cold, but... Refreshing from the sunlight. Does... Does that make sense?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" I shoot point-blank.\n\nHe buries his face under his hands and snow-strewn leaves with a crunch.\n\n\"Also, If the ice just melts, I don't think refreshing is the right word for it.\" I mumble, \"Have you gone into a just-thawed lake before?\"\n\n\"Mhmm,\" His response comes from under the leaves.\n\n\"You must have a stronger temperature resistance compared to Humans.\"\n\nI bury underneath too even though it's really cold! Clearing the leaves between us, I can finally see his face again. I smile and ask, \"Can we be friends, Crescia?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" He hops up and down in excitement.\n\nYou-! I'm still underneath here!\n\nCough, spit. \"Ptoo! Argghhh why you! There's leaves and dirt in my mouth now!\" Gagging and pouting, an idea pops into my head.\n\n\"AHHHHRRRR!\" I roar angrily with my hands shaped as claws.\n\nInstead of being scared, he breaks into laughter. \"Hahaha! Are you trying to be a bear, Aeriea?\"\n\nSulking a bit, I bury myself back under the leaves. \"It's colddd.\"\n\n\"O-Oh, did I say something bad? Sorry, uhm... I can tell what a lovely and lively garden this is. And since we're friends, I'll make them bloom a little earlier for you! So don't be sad, okay?\"\n\nHe begins rhythmically clicking his tongue in an odd, but oddly soothing way. After a bit, he takes a deep breath and clear notes ring out.\n\nThe slates of dead flowers, leaves, and snow suddenly blow away from above me. The cracked and dried dirt soften, as if freshly rained-upon. Plentiful sprouts gracefully bud out of the soil. Pop pop pop! They make a cute sound as the stems reach for the sky.\n\nWow... His voice is so beautiful.\n\nAt the height of his pitch, the swell of his crescendo, the very apex of his song - Every petal blooms in unison, some fluttering in the frosty wind.\n\nWe had grown up so differently, yet all it took was a single moment for our understandings to intertwine. And at that moment, I realize the meaning behind his earlier words - Comparing me to a frozen lake, thawed by warm wind and startling sunshine. I'm sure what he meant is what I'm feeling now.\n\nCrescia's voice is like the sound of spring.\n\n"
