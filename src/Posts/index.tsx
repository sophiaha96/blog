    body: `"Light filtering through glass and breaking into fractured colour. That was her last memory. Here though — a grim, yet beautifully lonely place. That was her first impression as her senses took everything in.  \n\nPeculiar. She couldn’t piece together any semblance of where, or what, this place was. Not that she could remember what her reference point was to begin with. All she knew was that this was not what she was used to.\n\n“Toll.” An impossibly deep voice resounded around her. She flickered to look at the source of sound.\n\n“Toll?” She parroted back, trying to search her pockets. But it was then that she realized she didn’t possess any appendages to do so. Or a body at all for that matter. \n\nBehind the voice was a river of obsidian. She peered into it and a reflection of formless mass peered back at her. Shadows with varying degrees of transparency unattached and attached itself back to her. It licked outwards like a greedy flame or fluttered gently like light, depending on how you saw things. Where irises, pupils, and sclera should be, were instead alabaster white. Her figure quivered in the windless air.\n\nWith her curiosity satisfied, she directed her attention back towards more pertinent matters. “What's the toll?“\n\nThey didn’t respond to her inquiry and the air quickly grew silent. She fluttered around in the wind, unsure of what to do. She thought to ask again, perhaps persistence in this matter would work. But before she could do so, a large explosion set off in the near distance. Flames exploded outwards, her periphery was dyed in a fiery red. Debris rained all around them, yet it did not affect her nor the Being that stood in front of the obsidian river. \n\nNo matter how she strained her vision, she couldn’t judge how far away it was. Things seemed both here, yet there. She thought it a bit odd, however the thought quickly dissipated into nothingness. \n\nFrom the dust rose a garnet flame, its figure was surprisingly similar to her own — As if shadow were shredded from a cloth and haphazardly sewn on, pieces of their physique fluttered in the wind.  The only difference was the hue and a sanguine shard embedded where she thought one’s heart would be. \n\n*Heart?* She was puzzled and looked down at herself once more. She was certain she knew what a heart was, but then where was it?\n\n“Toll.” The voice echoed yet again and painted the skies black. \n\nRed fumes turned to look at Them. “Have it,” He said as flames spit up a white-gold coin from his mouth. \n\nAha! She thought in exaltation, immediately trying to imitate the red poltergeist. After a few nauseating gags, she wondered what she was doing incorrectly.\n\nA deep chortle thundered, “Little one, you are in the wrong place. You are but a colorless and therefore, unaccomplished soul.” The flames danced around in amusement, “Asphodel is where you must go. However,” He stared at her, the whites in his eyes intense and ardent, “You seem amusing, little one. Reincarnate instead. Give yourself another chance so perhaps we will meet again when you are not so little.”\n\nShe froze under his fierce gaze, was she indeed not meant to be here? It seemed she did not have the toll required of her after all. \n\n“She is in the right place.”\n\nThe red-hot flame looked at the gatekeeper and shrugged before walking towards the dilapidated boat. “Well, then it is all the more amusing.” Once the fiery being set foot onto the creaky wood, mist engulfed the two and they disappeared across the lake.\n`

    title: "AL ONE",
    subtitle: "Short Story",
    chapter: 3,
    body: "Hurtling through space for a greater part of one’s youth and adulthood wasn’t what AL01 had expected their life to consist of. At least they had company alongside AL through AO’s 100 units per iteration. A total of 400 warm bodies.\n\nFor centuries now, their genetic sequences were mapped completely, able to be modified in order to express certain mutations and expressions. Each generation became more cutting-edge than the last. For instance, higher production of fat-processing hormones greatly decreased the risk of cardiovascular disease — They felt particularly bad such breakthrough technology couldn’t be applied to their predecessors. After all, one’s genetics could not be forcibly activated or hidden past the embryonic state. \n\nAnd so, as their forebears underwent experiments to further a more intense muscle building regimen needed for efficient space travel, without this essential mutation, a whole era was sacrificed for the betterment of society.\n\nBy the time the top performing 100 AO individuals were chosen to advance humanity’s frontiers, the Bx generation were about to be rolled out, deprecating a lot of the newer, more advanced genetic mutations administered to the Ax iteration.\n\nAt the time of their departure, plans containing step-by-step instructions for every contingency were charted and were still continuously revised by the artificial intelligence possessing quantum supremacy onboard their mothership. It was because of these thorough procedures that AL01 had the utmost confidence that their generation would do something wondrous. The first generation would have laid some form of groundwork by now, the second building upon the first’s sweat and toil. On and on it would go, creating something beautiful, something meaningful for civilization.\n\nThat was their firm belief even when the first sign of something amiss appeared.\n\n“What is that?” AO99 was the first to point out towards what should have been a desolate landscape. Through the porthole was a colossal structure spinning and gyrating at a consistent, yet furious rate. Much more so than any planet they’ve seen or studied about before. Although far out in the distance, they all immediately judged the sheer enormity such an object had to be to be seen under the profound darkness of space.\n\nHow could their sensors have missed something which ought to possess such a non-trivial gravitational pull? There were no signs of light or electricity or plasma, there were no reactions on their super magnets or radars to indicate poles or directions. But for such a mammoth thing to rotate like this, surely it possessed an electromagnetic field as well. Could this perhaps be some advanced technology of an unknown lifeform?\n\nThey had often deliberated on the existence of aliens, whether they would be more or less intelligent, what their culture or language would consist of, how their physical appearances would look, but most importantly, whether they would be friendly or hostile. \n\nThere was a deafening silence as their fleet re-routed towards the strange structure. Only the steady drone of beeping indicated the AI’s re-examination of indeterminate possibilities. \n\nCountless protocols ran through AL01’s head and an unaccustomed feeling washed over them. How would they prepare for first contact? What should happen if the other lifeforms were malicious? \n\nAll at once, a signal aired across the ships. It was unfamiliar and felt wrong. This off-put feeling intensified and a frigid chill settled into their bones. They were all prepped for the possibility that this could occur. No, they knew eventually the AI would be unable to resolve the myriad of unknowns and impossibilities that would incur over the course of their travels. The sound marked the passage of truly uncharted territory.\n\nEveryone seemed glued to the apertures, only an emptiness filling the spaces between… Between what? Them and us? The unknown and familiar? The trickling concern pooling around their consciousness was a dark and strange void.\n\n“We’ve trained all our lives for this,” AO99, suddenly spoke. “Do not lose heart. No matter what events unfold here, our cause - the advancement of humanity - will not be lost. Everything we do now will provide value to the next. There will be others who will take up the mantle. In this way, we will not fade into obscurity.” \n\nAn audible breaking of reverie could be heard amongst everyone. \n\nThey were right. It was almost laughable to be halted in their tracks due to fear. Onwards humanity would forge, as it always did, as it always had, generation after generation. Each one built upon the last like farmers which plant seed to soil to bloom.\n\nThe feeling dissipated as soon as it came. “AL01,” They were called up by AO99. “Please suit up and prepare for landing.“\n\nIt was protocol to send out the oldest units first, even incremental advancements in genetic modification could prove vital in such a mission. So why was it that AL00 wasn't called? Unfortunately, they malfunctioned early in the mission due to a voltage leak in the upload schema. Tragic indeed, but what stood out to AL01 more, was that such an early death seemed to be a harbinger on their mission. \n\nShaking the memories and uncanny feeling away, they turned their thoughts back to something brighter. Their life was not lost in vain. The malfunction was promptly fixed in ensuing models. Yes, it was because of them that saved the other 299 units from the same fate. Just as AL01 would do now.\n\nThe halls converged in on themselves and distorted more and more each step they took. They walked slowly to the airlock, still, time moved much too quickly. Bright lights shone against their face, the glare blinding. \n\nAfter donning the spacesuit, other units gathered around them. They wished them luck, gave words of encouragement, and applauded with gusto. AL01 tried to enjoy the cheer, but a bleak undertone roared and crashed against their eardrums.\n\n“This is as far as we can take you, AL01.” A shoulder pat from AO99 served only to make them more queasy, “If this is the last we see of you, on the behalf of humanity, I wish to tell you: thank you for your service.” \n\n*The advancement of humanity. The advancement of humanity.* They repeated these words as if it were a mantra, willing themself to have courage. *The advancement of-*\n\nThe airlock hissed open and all eyes eagerly awaited for AL01 to go beyond. For perhaps the last time, they took a deep inhalation of sweet, sweet, re-circulated air, before stepping inside the pressurized chamber. The barricade immediately shut, a flashing red light dyed their surroundings. When the other side opened, a deep void permeated all around. \n\nWith tether in hand, they slowly hopped out, making sure their velocity was not too great. The structure seemed impossibly large. Closer and closer the alien object grew, its size somehow seeming to expand even further. \n\n“That’s it, AL01.” The earpiece affirmed, their de-facto leader spoke in a steady tone. “You’re 3km from the superstructure.”\n\nIt felt as if centuries had passed by the time they drifted near enough to stretch out their fingers and touch the obsidian walls. Realistically, they couldn’t feel anything through the thick garment meant to keep all the harsh environmental factors out. However, AL01 would have liked to think it felt smooth to touch. As glacial and biting as its surroundings.\n\nAll at once, yet also somehow expected, something lit up a distant blue. On the periphery, they could see movement on one of the structural arms far off. Utilizing the helmet’s optical technology, they zoomed in on the activity — a door had opened. \n\nAfter relaying this newfound information to base, AL01 made the trek (drift) over. The opening was even smaller than they imagined. Still, it suffused a mellow azure light, shining more deeply and further than one would expect in this deep and dark expanse. \n\nOnce inside, the entrance — or exit, depending on how one saw it — closed shut. A pressurized vapour filled the chamber, most likely sanitization and perhaps atmospheric gases. They opted to keep their helmet on though. as they were unsure whether alien lifeforms would require the same gases required by humans. But indeed, it was off. For all intents and purposes, this place resembled the airlocks they had seen so many times before.\n\nThey half-expected some alien contact after the next door’s chamber opened. So it was perhaps even more shocking that no one awaited them. Motion sensors immediately detected their presence and lit the hallway up, it was smooth and empty. \n\n“AO99?” They spoke into the receiver, no response save for static answered back.\n\nAlthough unnerved, they calmly turned on the spacesuit’s built-in logger and transmission system. It would transmit every last piece of information at the first chance possible once reconnected. This included vitals, data from the inertial navigation system, electromagnetic readings, as well as any sound logs. The default title was simply the date and time of creation, but it was good and standard practice to give a more descriptive name.\n\nThe walk felt heavy and it wasn’t until a couple minutes passed that they became increasingly aware of this nostalgic strain on their body. “Gravity?” They vocalized aloud in shock. \n\n*What need would alien beings have to simulate gravitational force?* \n\nSome intuitive understanding settled in their gut and their hesitant steps soon became a sprint. When their helmet became too stuffy, they threw it off in a fit. Then jogged back and picked it up, continuing to run with the bulky thing. They kept turning corner after corner, throwing open door after door. The familiar floor plan made their stomach churn ever so increasingly as each room proved empty. \n\nThey saved the control centre for last. \n\nAs AL01 entered, a steady drone hummed in the background. They walked up to a computer station and searched through the file, typing command after command to get a sense of the situation. In the system was a whole host of papers and research and logs filled to the brim with data. They detailed maps of planetary terrain much further out, technology far more advanced than this generation could have thought possible, decades upon decades of journals on psychological and medical research. \n\nA realization dawned upon AL01 — humanity must have had a breakthrough in faster space travel technology and managed to colonize generations upon generations. \n\n*Time dilation was a bitch*, they grimaced.\n\nAlthough a bit bitter about this unexpected development, they suppressed both that and the gnawing feeling that something wasn’t right. \n\nThe last file available was titled a date and time, uncharacteristically ill-defined. Perhaps it would have been better to look through the logs in chronological order. However, all they could think about was the ending. \n\nThey clicked the file open. It was eerily quiet, only white noise filtering into their ears. \n\nOnly a single mumble was heard in the entirety of the audio clip. AL01 had never heard such an all-encompassing despair in a voice before. “It’s all over.” This and a single click resounded, finalizing the end of the transmission.\n\nThey stiffened, unable to understand or process what had happened. A few minutes of pure shock passed before they suddenly and very desperately rummaged through that day’s metadata for any semblance of a clue. But that log held nothing of value. There were 25 other units still active and although that was a meagre amount compared to the sheer size of this superstructure, there was nothing to indicate anything was wrong. All vitals were normal, there had been no indication of hostile intrusions or coup uprisings. No disease or sudden surge in radiation or temperature or atmospheric pressure. \n\nThey retraced their steps backward, one at a time through the logs. Before long, an aberrant trend started to emerge. Like clockwork, every couple of months, a unit would abruptly and seemingly without cause, die. \n\nThis abnormality provoked all the other units to collectively throw themselves at research. It wasn’t long before they zeroed in on the mutation causing it. AL01 didn’t have the knowledge or understanding of such advanced scientific breakthroughs. Try as they might, the only information they could parse from this disconnected language was about a seemingly benign sequence of DNA which allowed for greater cardiac metabolism. Deemed safe, it was one of the first discoveries in epigenetics. Soon this genetic modification became standardized and rolled out to every model for promise of greater quality of life. Who would have thought that such an inconsequential genetic expression from iterations past would mutate under very specific conditions? Namely, accelerated space travel. Atmospheric pressure, temperature, PH of their bodily fluids, etcetera etcetera were a few of the myriad of factors.\n\nSuch a small oversight. \n\nAnd yet the realization slowly dawned upon AL01. They had this same mutation. Everyone in their fleet possessed it. The society they left behind had it.\n\nA great light snuffed out.\n\nCamaraderie, hope, perseverance. It whispered of purpose one last time before decaying. All was a withered field. They fell onto their knees and only the all-encompassing void of space was there to greet them."

    body: "The blue flame huffed out in irritation. He understood that it was irresponsible to abandon his post, and this hot-headedness was unbecoming of a spirit guide. Shouldn’t he be used to Their immature antics by now? Yet still, he would flare up at every single provocation. \n\nThose throw-away comments of Theirs hadn’t used to bother him. But over time, Their barbed words grew like an itch you thought too hard about. \n\n*Death truly did drive one mad.* \n\nHe snorted at his clever wordplay, before stopping in his proverbial tracks and grew deadly silent.\n\nThey were right. He truly was becoming more and more influenced by mortal concepts. Exclaiming in human euphemisms was one thing. Getting caught up with trivial affairs was an entirely different beast. This petty behaviour was indicative of inferior lifeforms.  \n\nBut it was only natural, considering his sole other contact besides his infuriating coworker, was with humans. Zeus-knows-how-long he was shackled to Them. It was nigh impossible to go without being afflicted in some way. \n\n— Was how he justified it to himself.\n\nMaybe he should consider retirement soon… But there were only 200 more souls to be collected until his pension was available for payout — a single stater of electrum. Half gold, a bit less than half silver, the remainder being copper (the Elysium monetary dispensary was growing sparse in gold, so had to skimp). A white-gold coinage emblazoned with the seal of the Gods. While its material worth was mediocre at best, its true worth was immeasurable. \n\nOnly this coin could be exchanged as toll to passage across Styx. \n\nThe damp breeze inherent to places near water clung onto his form. He hated how it diminished his being. He hated his colleague. He hated how his colleague made him feel. He hated it here. Alas, the reminder of wage compelled him to turn back. \n\nWhile dejectedly backtracking, a murmuring noise began whispering in the distance. He ignored it even when it crescendoed to a hushed buzzing. All at once a great sound thundered throughout the air. Locusts swarmed the skies above, surging like limbs with free reign over their host. Like headless snakes, he thought in awe while remembering his chance encounter with Medusa a lifetime ago.\n\nHe spotted it then, chariots of black that sucked in all light. Mares of dusk galloping, taking with them a certain associate of his.\n\nSnapping out of it, another very mortal term was let loose as he swore under his breath."

    body: "Untold was the wind, in all its fury and might lay a quiet strength. Chained to no one, its power could not be overcome with the meagre flights of fancy which were characteristic of man. Neither thoughtless mistakes, nor vice could bring about the downfall of a god. But what of gods risen from man itself; do they possess the same affliction to undoing?\n\nA biting chill ran through their spine simultaneously. It was their time. \n\nOne stepped forward, a single pace closer towards the estuary of Styx. The other held fast, but winds of change always blew one towards their fate, regardless of a mere individual’s wish. Cocytus raged and cracked against the shore of dusty debris. Only three remained in the confines of perpetuity. The boundary between life and the underworld.\n\n“There is no rush.” Truly, time here did not pass as easily as it flowed above. It was barred against its will at this juncture. Nothing could pass without the permission of this place’s overseer. Whether it be mortal or the fabric of nature itself.\n\nThe others accepted, resigned, fought. Did it matter? Acheron, Lethe, and Phlegethon converged where it was always meant to converge.  \n\nIn this place and time, all were offered the same choice.\n\nHere, at this crossroad, or cross-river, was where something ended and something else began. \n\n\n“This is truly the bane of my existence,” They complained loudly.\n\n“Don’t you feel shame at using such mortal colloquialisms?” The blue flame bounced in agitation. “In the first place, your very existence is to uphold this tradition of leading souls into the afterlife. There is nothing banal or of bane in your duty.” All fires burned out eventually (though there existed quite a fair number of exceptions). It was Their charge to ferry souls as they extinguished.\n\n“Try doing this job your entire life with no end in sight, you’d think it dreadful in no time at all,” They retorted back.\n\nThe flame flickered in irritation, “Again with your very human expressions. Time does not pass here and you do not have a life.”\n\n“Tell me about it!”\n\n“Enough!” He burst, “I cannot stand your ceaseless whining for even a second longer!”\n\n“Seconds,“ They paused for emphasis, “Now who’s speaking in mortal terms?”\n\n“You may think yourself of wit, but although you are millennia in the making, you act as juvenile as a mortal child!” Azure flames flared, the tendrils scattered in all directions. Indeed, the spirit guide had had enough with Them and went to go cool off. \n\nWhen the last vestiges quivered gone, They picked up their scythe. “Finally, some peace and quiet,” The harbinger of bereavement twirled in Their hands as easily as rain danced upon pools of water. “What a nag.” \n\nQuickly, They made preparations, driven by the covet of being left alone by the aforementioned nag. Mares of shadow neighed against the backdrop of a crackling storm which was steadily brewing. Darkness swept over the skies as Death rode their chariot towards the mortal realm. \n\nWherever They went, plague, war, and chaos did not fall far behind. In more apt terms, everytime They decided to play hooky, great destruction rained upon the human world. \n\nA great and terrible lesson was learned during 1250 BC. To the chagrin of the gods, Death managed to evade Their duties for ten years. So now, They had to be babysat, lest the Fields of Asphodel become overwhelmingly crowded yet again.\n\nBack to the present, it was thus that such an oversight brought five particularly unfortunate souls here. They converged at this boundary due to mere whimsy. \n"
